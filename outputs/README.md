  # [![License: The Unlicensed]()]() README Generator

  ## Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a high-quality README for the app. This app is a command-line application to auto-generate one, which includes the title of the app, a description of the app, how to use, install the app, as well as how to report issues and make any contributions to the app. (Is it cool when you know that this README.md is generated by this application?)
